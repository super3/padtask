Daily notes with smarter tasks.

## Why

Traditional todo apps strip away context - they're great at "Book flight to NYC" but terrible at holding your flight research, price comparisons, and travel notes. Meanwhile, journal apps excel at capturing everything but fail at task management.

PadTask bridges this gap. It's a daily journal where tasks live alongside their context. Tasks can expand with research notes, automatically flow to tomorrow when incomplete, and maintain their full history. Capture "Book NYC flight" with all your airline comparisons, price tracking, and schedule considerations in one place - then watch it intelligently carry forward until done.
